2. I notice that there are several parameters for the classifiers. For this assignment I just use the default settings.
   And I train the k-nearest neighbors classifier and SVM classifier by the context vectors I obtained in part 1. 

   Then I use the two different classifiers to do classification on training data. The SVM classifier gives us an 
   accuracy of 100%. And I obtain an accuracy of 68.9185750636% based on the k-nearest neighbors classifier. 

   It seems that SVM has a better performance on training data than the k-nearest neighbors classifier did. However,
   we cannot ignore the overfitting which may occur in the training process.
